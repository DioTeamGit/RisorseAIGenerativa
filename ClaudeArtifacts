Claude Sonnet 3.5 Artifacts support six main types:
1. code snippets,
2. markdown documents,
3. HTML pages,
4. SVG images,
5. Mermaid diagrams,
6. React components.

Here are the details about all 6 types with some general details about Artifacts ... 

1. Code Snippets (application/vnd.ant.code)

- Purpose: For sharing code in any programming language
- Usage:
  - Specify the language using the `language` attribute
  - Do not use triple backticks within the artifact
- Examples of languages: Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Ruby, React etc.
- External scripts can only be imported from cloudflare

2. Documents (text/markdown)

- Purpose: For longer text content or formatted documents
- Supports:
  - Plain text
  - Markdown formatting (headers, lists, links, etc.)

3. HTML Pages (text/html)

- Purpose: For creating renderable web pages
- Features:
  - Can include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file
  - Will be rendered as a webpage in the user interface
- Limitations:
  - External scripts can only be imported from cdn of cloudflare
  - Cannot use external images
- Placeholder images:
  - Use `/api/placeholder/width/height` format
  - Example: `<img src="/api/placeholder/400/320" alt="placeholder" />`

 4. SVG Images (image/svg+xml)

- Purpose: For creating vector graphics
- Features:
  - Scalable graphics that can be rendered in the user interface
  - Should specify the viewBox rather than width/height

5. Mermaid Diagrams (application/vnd.ant.mermaid)

- Purpose: For creating various types of diagrams
- Supports diagram types like:
  - Flowcharts
  - Sequence diagrams
  - Gantt charts
  - Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
  - User Journey Diagrams
- Best for:
  - Visualizing processes
  - Showing relationships between entities
  - Timelines or schedules

 6. React Components (application/vnd.ant.react)

- Purpose: For creating interactive UI components
- Can include:
  - React elements (e.g., `<strong>Hello World!</strong>`)
  - Pure functional components
  - Functional components with Hooks
  - React component classes
- Available libraries:
  - Base React (including Hooks)
  - lucide-react@0.263.1 for icons
  - recharts for creating charts
  - Prebuilt components from shadcn/ui library
- Styling:
  - Use Tailwind classes (avoid arbitrary values like `h-[600px]`)
- Limitations:
  - Cannot import libraries other than those mentioned
  - Cannot use external images (use placeholders instead)

 General Guidelines for Artifacts

1. Content Suitability:
   - Should be substantial (typically >15 lines)
   - Self-contained and understandable without conversation context
   - Likely to be modified, reused, or referenced multiple times

2. When Not to Use Artifacts:
   - For simple, short, or primarily explanatory content
   - For content highly dependent on conversation context
   - For one-off questions or examples

3. Usage Notes:
   - Generally, create one artifact per message unless specifically requested otherwise
   - Prefer in-line content when possible to maintain conversation flow
   - Can update existing artifacts using the same identifier to show evolution of content

4. Limitations:
   - Cannot include external images (except specified placeholders)
   - Cannot import libraries other than those explicitly mentioned for React components
